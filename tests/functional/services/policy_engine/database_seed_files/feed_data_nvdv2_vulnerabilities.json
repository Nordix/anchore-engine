{"name":"CVE-2020-8908","namespace_name":"nvdv2:cves","severity":"Low","description":"A temp directory creation vulnerability exists in all versions of Guava, allowing an attacker with access to the machine to potentially access data in a temporary directory created by the Guava API com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir(). By default, on unix-like systems, the created directory is world-readable (readable by an attacker with access to the system). The method in question has been marked @Deprecated in versions 30.0 and later and should not be used. For Android developers, we recommend choosing a temporary directory API provided by Android, such as context.getCacheDir(). For other Java developers, we recommend migrating to the Java 7 API java.nio.file.Files.createTempDirectory() which explicitly configures permissions of 700, or configuring the Java runtime's java.io.tmpdir system property to point to a location whose permissions are appropriately configured.","cvss_v2":{"additional_information": {"ac_insuf_info": false, "obtain_all_privilege": false, "obtain_other_privilege": false, "obtain_user_privilege": false, "user_interaction_required": false}, "base_metrics": {"access_complexity": "LOW", "access_vector": "LOCAL", "authentication": "NONE", "availability_impact": "NONE", "base_score": 2.1, "confidentiality_impact": "PARTIAL", "exploitability_score": 3.9, "impact_score": 2.9, "integrity_impact": "NONE"}, "severity": "Low", "vector_string": "AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N", "version": "2.0"},"cvss_v3":{"base_metrics": {"attack_complexity": "LOW", "attack_vector": "LOCAL", "availability_impact": "NONE", "base_score": 3.3, "base_severity": "Low", "confidentiality_impact": "LOW", "exploitability_score": 1.8, "impact_score": 1.4, "integrity_impact": "NONE", "privileges_required": "LOW", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "user_interaction": "NONE"}, "vector_string": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "version": "3.1"},"link":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8908","references":[{"source": "CONFIRM", "tags": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "url": "https://github.com/google/guava/commit/fec0dbc4634006a6162cfd4d0d09c962073ddf40"}, {"source": "CONFIRM", "tags": ["Third Party Advisory"], "url": "https://github.com/google/guava/issues/4011"}, {"source": "MLIST", "tags": ["Mailing List", "Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r215b3d50f56faeb2f9383505f3e62faa9f549bb23e8a9848b78a968e@%3Ccommits.ws.apache.org%3E"}, {"source": "MLIST", "tags": ["Mailing List", "Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r4776f62dfae4a0006658542f43034a7fc199350e35a66d4e18164ee6@%3Ccommits.cxf.apache.org%3E"}, {"source": "MLIST", "tags": ["Mailing List", "Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r68d86f4b06c808204f62bcb254fcb5b0432528ee8d37a07ef4bc8222@%3Ccommits.ws.apache.org%3E"}, {"source": "MLIST", "tags": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r841c5e14e1b55281523ebcde661ece00b38a0569e00ef5e12bd5f6ba@%3Cissues.maven.apache.org%3E"}, {"source": "MLIST", "tags": ["Mailing List", "Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rb8c0f1b7589864396690fe42a91a71dea9412e86eec66dc85bbacaaf@%3Ccommits.cxf.apache.org%3E"}, {"source": "MISC", "tags": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rbc7642b9800249553f13457e46b813bea1aec99d2bc9106510e00ff3@%3Ctorque-dev.db.apache.org%3E"}, {"source": "MLIST", "tags": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rc2dbc4633a6eea1fcbce6831876cfa17b73759a98c65326d1896cb1a@%3Ctorque-dev.db.apache.org%3E"}, {"source": "MLIST", "tags": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rd5d58088812cf8e677d99b07f73c654014c524c94e7fedbdee047604@%3Ctorque-dev.db.apache.org%3E"}, {"source": "MISC", "tags": ["Exploit", "Third Party Advisory"], "url": "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMGOOGLEGUAVA-1015415"}],"created_at":"2021-01-29T11:43:28.418168","updated_at":"2021-02-18T09:17:23.426648"}
